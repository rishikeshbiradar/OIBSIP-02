        <h2 class="biographyHeading">Biography:</h2>
        <p class="biographyPara">Sir Ratan Naval Tata (born 28 December 1937) is an Indian industrialist
            and former chairman of
            Tata Sons. He was also the chairman of the Tata Group from 1990 to 2012, serving also as interim chairman
            from
            October 2016 through February 2017. He continues to head its charitable trusts.[2][3] In 2008, he received
            the
            Padma Vibhushan, the second highest civilian honour in India, after receiving the Padma Bhushan, the third
            highest civilian honour in 2000.[4]

            He is the son of Naval Tata, who was adopted by Ratanji Tata, son of Jamsetji Tata, the founder of the Tata
            Group. He graduated from the Cornell University College of Architecture with a bachelor's degree in
            architecture, and the Harvard Business School through a management course he completed in 1975.[5] He joined
            Tata in 1961, where he worked on the shop floor of Tata Steel. He later succeeded J. R. D. Tata's as
            chairman of
            Tata Sons upon the latter's retirement in 1991. Under his tenure the Tata Group acquired Tetley, Jaguar Land
            Rover, and Corus, in an attempt to turn Tata from a largely India-centric group into a global business. Tata
            is
            also one of the largest philanthropists in the world, having donated around 60–65% of his income to charity.
